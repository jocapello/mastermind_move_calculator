# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204!

Change this README.md file to summarize your project, and provide pointers to the general structure of the repository. How you organize and build things (which files, how you structure things, etc) is entirely up to you! The only things you must keep in place are what is already listed in the **Structure** section below.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
